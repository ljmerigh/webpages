    <p>My name is <ins>Lucas Merighi</ins>. 
    I am a <em>freshman</em> and plan on majoring in Paper Science Engineering and Chemical Engineering.
    I am interested in these majors because I want to help biuld a more <b>sustainble</b> world and these majors will help me towards that goal.</p>

    <p style="color:blue; font-family: times; font-size: 200%; text-align: center;">A job that I had over the summer was a beach lifeguard in New Jersey.
	I did this because I love the ocean, spending time on the beach, and am a great swimmer.The job was a lot of fun but also a lot of responsibility. 
	I plan on also doing this job next summer.</p>
